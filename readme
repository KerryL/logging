This collection of classes are used in several of my projects, so I decided to break them out as a submodule for ease of maintenance.  This file contains some notes about using the classes contained in this repository.

The CombinedLogger class is thread-safe and in order to achieve thread-safety, it uses the MutexLocker class from my utilities repository.  As a result, any project using the CombinedLogger class should also include the utilities repository (https://github.com/KerryL/utilities).  The include directives that specify mutexLocker.h do not include any path.  It is recommended that users add the utilities submodule directory to their include path.

There are several guides online for using git submodules.  Here is my summary of the most useful git commands.
- To add logging to your project as a submodule:
$ cd <root directory of your superproject>
$ git submodule add https://github.com/KerryL/logging.git

NOTE:  To add a submodule within another directory, the destination must be specified following the repository url, so instead of the last step above, it would be:
$ git submodule add https://github.com/KerryL/logging.git <desired path>/logging

- Cloning a repository using a submodule now requires a couple of extra steps:
$ git clone ...
$ cd <project directory created by above clone command>
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

NOTE:  If your submodules are not in your projects root folder, you'll need to specify that the submodule update should recurse into other folders.  Replace the last command above with:
$ git submodule update --recursive
